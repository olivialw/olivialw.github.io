            <h3>Digital Security</h3>
         
          <hr>
          <p>
            Digital security can feel like a scary topic, both because it can be emotionally challenging and because the learning curve can be steep. The list of ‘to-dos’ often feels overwhelming, even for the most technologically adept.
          </p>
          <p>
            The workshops I run (often with some excellent co-collaborators!) break things down so that everyone can feel ownership over digital security basics and feel more empowered both over their personal digital security and to share back what they’ve learned to their collectives and organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think of digital security work as a form of mutual aid and community care. Much of what I know has been taught to me by wonderful comrades, friends, and mentors and via many of the resources below.
          </p>

          <p>
            White nationalists and other right-wing actors have a history of targeting organizers for harassment, intimidation, and doxxing. As we decide how we want to exist in digital spaces, these workshops will give participants the tools to prevent personal information from being found in places that they did not intend it to be. Being public about our political work is powerful, but we can only make consensual choices about the information we share if we fully understand the risks and how to mitigate them. Equipping ourselves and our communities with knowledge and skills to protect ourselves is a key part of ensuring our movements are sustainable in the long term.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Digital Security 101:</b> This presentation is geared toward those who have no- or very little- prior experience with digital security. We will explain what digital security is, why it’s important, and how/why it applies to you and your communities. We will introduce you to new terminology and concepts in ways that are easy to understand for newbies and using a trauma-informed, feminist lens, with the goal of demystifying digital security so it can feel more accessible to you. We can tailor our content to your specific organizing context, and can incorporate some hands-on work as well, if desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            <b>Digital Security 201:</b> This workshop is geared toward those who have some prior understanding of digital security but who have yet to take much action on changing their digital practices. This interactive workshop introduces participants to digital security through a feminist, trauma informed lens and is an accessible, hands-on session. We’ll cover performing a personal and community risk assessment, locking down social media, installing and using a password manager, enabling 2-factor authentication, performing safe(r) research, and how to begin scrubbing personal information from data brokers. Participants will leave with "homework" to keep working on and resources to bring back to their communities.
          </p>
